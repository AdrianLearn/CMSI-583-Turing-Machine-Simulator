# CMSI-583-Turing-Machine-Simulator
Turing Machine Simulator written in JS for CMSI-583, Computability and Complexity

Given a machine of states and transitions, our program will run to determine whether an input string will be accepted by a Turing machine. 

The given machine, seen in ``exampleMachine.txt``, will recognize all strings that start with 1, followed by half as many 0's. 

For our example, run ``node turingMachine.js 111100 < exampleMachine.txt``
